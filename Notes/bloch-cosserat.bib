  Abstract                 = {A method with which standard finite element programs can be used to compute dispersion relations in periodic composites is proposed. The method is applied to two composite microstructures: a two-phase laminate and a fiber composite. The dispersion relations computed for the laminate are compared with a known analytical solution and the agreement is very good. The dispersion relations computed for the fibrous composite are compared with an existing approximate model and experimental results from the literature. The agreement between the approximate model, the experiments, and the computations is very good in the wave guide case and satisfactory for the wave reflect case.},

We demonstrate the ability to use deformation to transform phononic band gaps. Periodic elastomeric structures are subjected to axial compression and are found to undergo a transformation in their patterned structure upon reaching a critical value of applied load. During the initial linear regime of the nominal stress-strain behavior, the band gaps evolve in an affine and marginal manner. Upon reaching the critical load, the pattern transformation is found to strongly affect the in-plane phononic band gaps, resulting in the closure of existing band gaps and in the opening of new ones. The elastomeric nature of the material makes the transformation in both structural pattern and phononic band gap a reversible and repeatable process, creating a phononic band gap switch.},

  Abstract                 = {The present work deals with the development of homogenization procedures for periodic heterogeneous linear elastic Cosseratmedia. It is resorted to asymptotic methods classically used in periodic homogenization. It is shown that the nature of the homogeneous equivalent medium depends on the hierarchy of three characteristic lengths: the size l of the heterogeneities, the Cosserat intrinsic lengths lc of the constituents and the typical size L of the considered structure. When l and lc are comparable and much smaller than L, the effective medium is proved to be a Cauchy continuum with volume couples, whereas the case lc∼L leads to a Cosserat effective medium. Finite element simulations are provided in the case of a fiber-matrix composite for a large range of characteristic lengths lc and for two different volume fractions. Reference calculations involving every heterogeneity are compared to the response obtained using a homogeneous equivalent medium. The results confirm the predicted hierarchy of models and also show that a Cosserat effective medium still provide a good estimation when all characteristic lengths have the same order of magnitude.},

We used a criterion for the compression of the resulting matrices from the BEM to decrease the computational costs and could handle bigger problems.

En the second part is is described the formulation and implementation of an analysis tool for the wave propagation in periodic heterogeneous materials. This is useful to caracterize the bulk properties when it is a wave traveling through the material with a particular frequency. For this we used diverse concepts from the solid state physics and the solution is baes on the Bloch's theorem.},

  Abstract                 = {The finite element approach has been previously used, with the help of the ATILA code, to model the scattering of acoustic waves by single periodic structures, such as compliant tube gratings [A. C. Hennion et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 1861–1870 (1990)]. In this paper, the same approach is extended to doubly periodic structures, such as Alberich anechoic coatings. To do this, only the unit cell of the periodic structure, including a small part of the surrounding fluid domain, has to be meshed, due to the use of classical Bloch type relations. Then, the effects of the remaining fluid domain are accounted for by matching the pressure field in the finite element mesh with simple plane wave expansions of the ingoing and outgoing waves. After an outline of the method, the paper describes the results obtained for the scattering of a plane wave by different periodic structures. Internal losses are taken into account and the incident plane wave impinges at normal or oblique incidence. Numerical results obtained for Alberich anechoic coatings are first analyzed to check the convergence and then compared to previous numerical results or to experimental results, demonstrating that the finite element approach is accurate and well suited to predict the behavior of these gratings. Moreover, careful attention is devoted to the analysis of the inclusion vibrations, to identify the origin of the resonance mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to develop more and more resource-saving strategies for engineering tasks, the efficient application of cellular materials, such as various open cell foams, is of high interest in science and technology. Strongly influenced by their underlying microtopology, cellular materials feature a complex material behaviour. Modelling aspects to be taken into account are e. g. the deformation induced evolution of anisotropy and porosity on the one hand and the description of size dependent stiff or soft boundary layers, activated by the interaction close to material interfaces, on the other hand.

The present contribution is focusing on that second feature by introducing a numerical homogenisation procedure. It allows to replace the heterogeneous microcontinuum by a homogeneous micromorphic macrocontinuum. Doing so, the microstructural deformation mechanisms can be geometrically interpreted as generalised degrees of freedom, which can be transferred on the macroscopic level. In the context of a FE2 strategy, the macroscopic constitutive equations are replaced by the computation of a nested microscopic boundary value problem in each macroscopic material point.

The power of the proposed interpretation of the micromorphic degrees of freedom in combination with the numerical homogenisation approach is demonstrated for several microstructures in various numerical experiments validated in comparison to numerical reference calculations.},

Within the framework of Cosserat continuum, both the Rayleigh and surface transverse waves in a half-space are dispersive.

C. Hladky-Hennion et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 90, 3356–3367 (1991)]. This paper presents a new extension of this technique to the analysis of the propagation of plane acoustic waves in passive periodic materials without losses and describes with particular emphasis its application to doubly periodic materials containing different types of inclusions. In the proposed approach, only the unit cell of the periodic material has to be meshed, thanks to Bloch–Floquet relations. The modeling of these materials provides dispersion curves from which results of physical interest can be easily extracted: identification of propagation modes, cutoff frequencies, passbands, stopbands, as well as effective homogeneous properties. In this paper, the general method is first described, and particularly the aspects related to the periodicity. Then a test example is given for which analytical results exist. This example is followed by detailed presentations of finite element results, in the case of periodic materials containing inclusions or cylindrical pores. The homogenized properties of porous materials are determined with the help of an anisotropic model, in the large wavelength limit. A validation has been carried out with periodically perforated plates, the resonance frequencies of which have been measured. The efficiency and the versatility of the method is thus clearly demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we suggest a new perspective, where Newton's second law of motion is replaced by a more general law which is a better approximation for describing the motion of seemingly rigid macroscopic bodies. We confirm a finding of Willis that the density of a body at a given frequency of oscillation can be anisotropic. The relation between the force and the acceleration is non-local (but causal) in time. Conversely, for every response function satisfying these properties, and having the appropriate high-frequency limit, there is a model which realizes that response function. In many circumstances, the differences between Newton's second law and the new law are small, but there are circumstances, such as in specially designed composite materials, where the difference is enormous. For bodies which are not seemingly rigid, the continuum equations of elastodynamics govern behaviour and also need to be modified. The modified versions of these equations presented here are a generalization of the equations proposed by Willis to describe elastodynamics in composite materials. It is argued that these new sets of equations may apply to all physical materials, not just composites. The Willis equations govern the behaviour of the average displacement field whereas one set of new equations governs the behaviour of the average-weighted displacement field, where the weighted displacement field may attach zero weight to ‘hidden’ areas in the material where the displacement may be unobservable or not defined. From knowledge of the average-weighted displacement field, one obtains an approximate formula for the ensemble averaged energy density. Two other sets of new equations govern the behaviour when the microstructure has microinertia, i.e. where there are internal spinning masses below the chosen scale of continuum modelling. In the first set, the average displacement field is assumed to be observable, while in the second set an average-weighted displacement field is assumed to be observable.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates wave propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear periodic structures subject to point harmonic forcing. The infinite lattice is modeled as a spring-mass system consisting of linear and cubic-nonlinear stiffness. The effects of nonlinearity on harmonic wave propagation are analytically predicted using a novel perturbation approach. Response is characterized by group velocity contours (derived from phase-constant contours) functionally dependent on excitation amplitude and the nonlinear stiffness coefficients. Within the pass band there is a frequency band termed the caustic band where the resonse is characterized by the appearance of low amplitude regions or dead zones. For a two-dimensional lattice having asymmetric nonlinearity, it is shown tat these caustic bands are dependent on the excitation amplitude, unlike in corresponding linear models. The analytical predictions obtained are verified via comparisons to responses generated using a time-domain simulation of a finite two-dimensional nonlinear lattice. Lastly, the study demonstrates amplitude-dependent wve beaming in two-dimensional nonlinear periodic structures.},

The models have their origin in the atomistic representations of matter on one hand, and in the truss-type systems in engineering on the other. The paper evolves by first giving a rather detailed presentation of one-dimensional and planar lattice models for classical continua. This is followed by a section on applications in mechanics of composites and key computational aspects. We then return to planar lattice models made of beams, which are a discrete counterpart of non-classical continua. The final two sections of the paper are devoted to issues of connectivity and rigidity of networks, and lattices of disordered (rather than periodic) topology. Spring network models offer an attractive alternative to finite element analyses of planar systems ranging from metals, composites, ceramics and polymers to functionally graded and granular materials, whereby a fiber network model of paper is treated in considerable detail.

  Abstract                 = {Normal mode analysis using elastic network models has grown popular for probing the low-frequency collective dynamics of proteins and other biomolecular assemblies. In most previous studies, these models were validated by comparing calculated atomic fluctuations for isolated proteins with experimental temperature factors determined in the crystalline state, although there were also hints that including crystal contacts in the calculations has an impact on the comparison. In this study, a set of 83 ultra-high resolution crystal structures with experimentally determined anisotropic displacement parameters is used to evaluate several Ca-based elastic network models that either ignore or treat the crystal environment in different ways; the latter include using periodic boundary conditions defined with respect to the asymmetric unit or the primitive unit cell as well as using the Born-von Ka´rma´n boundary condition that accounts for lattice vibrations. For all elastic network models, treating the crystal environment leads to better agreement with experimental anisotropic displacement parameters with the Born-von Karman boundary condition giving the best agreement. Atomic correlations over the entire protein are clearly affected by the presence of the crystal contacts and fairly sensitive to the way that the crystal environment is treated. These observations highlight the importance of properly treating the protein system in an environment consistent with experiment when either evaluating approximate protein models or using approximate dynamic models in structural refinement application types. Finally, investigation of the scaling behaviors of the cumulative density of states and the heat capacity indicates that there are still gaps between simplified elastic models and all-atom models for proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular structures like honeycombs or reticulated micro-frames are widely used in sandwich construction because of their superior structural static and dynamic properties. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dynamic behavior of two-dimensional cellular structures, with the focus on the effect of the geometry of unit cells on the dynamics of the propagation of elastic waves within the structure. 

The characteristics of wave propagation for the considered class of cellular solids are analyzed through the finite element model of the unit cell and the application of the theory of periodic structures. This combined analysis yields the phase constant surfaces, which define the directions of waves propagating in the plane of the structure for the assigned frequency values. The analysis of iso-frequency contour lines in the phase constant surfaces allows the prediction of the location and extension of angular ranges, and therefore regions within the structures where waves do not propagate. 

The performance of honeycomb grids of regular hexagonal topology is compared with that of grids of various geometries, with the emphasis on configurations featuring a negative Poisson’s ratio behavior. The harmonic response of the considered structures at specified frequencies confirms the predictions from the analysis of the phase constant surfaces and demonstrates the strongly spatially-dependent characteristics of periodic cellular structures.

The numerical results presented indicate the potentials of the phase constant surfaces as tools for the evaluation of the wave propagation characteristics of this class of two-dimensional periodic structures. Optimal design configurations can be identified in order to achieve the desired transmissibility levels in specified directions and to obtain efficient vibration isolation capabilities. The findings from the presented investigations and the described analysis methodology will provide invaluable guidelines for the prototyping of future concepts of honeycombs or cellular structures with enhanced vibro-acoustics performance.},

Long-wavelength asymptotes to the dispersion curves based on homogenization theory are in good agreement with the numerical results for each of the four lattices. The slenderness ratio of the constituent beams of the lattice (or relative density) has a significant influence on the band structure. The techniques developed in this work can be used to design lattices with a desired band structure.

We consider the quantum-mechanical problem in a crystalline solid, and derive the weak formulation and matrix equations for the SchrÄodinger and Poisson equations in a parallelepiped unit cell under Bloch-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, respectively. For such second-order problems, these conditions consist of value- and derivative-periodic parts. The value-periodic part is enforced as an essential boundary condition by construction of a value-periodic basis, whereas the derivative-periodic part is enforced as a natural boundary condition in the weak formulation. We show that the resulting matrix equations can be obtained by suitably specifying the connectivity of element matrices in the assembly of the global matrices or by modifying the Neumann matrices via row and column operations. The implementation and accuracy of the new formulation is demonstrated via numerical examples for the three-dimensional Poisson and Schrodinger equations using classical and enriched (partition-of-unity) higher-order Funite elements.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a coupled atomistic–continuum method for the modeling of defects and interface dynamics in crystalline materials. The method uses atomistic models such as molecular dynamics near defects and interfaces, and continuum models away from defects and interfaces. We propose a new class of matching conditions between the atomistic and the continuum regions. These conditions ensure the accurate passage of large-scale information between the atomistic and the continuum regions and at the same time minimize the reflection of phonons at the atomistic–continuum interface. They can be made adaptive by choosing appropriate weight functions. We present applications to dislocation dynamics, friction between two-dimensional crystal surfaces, and fracture dynamics. We compare results of the coupled method and of the detailed atomistic model.},
